### Screenshot

![./design/myresult.png](./design/myresult.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

In this exercise we have a design folder in which there are some image about how the site have to look, the images folder in which there are all image needed for thsi exercise; the idex.html for creating all component and the style.css to add some style toour components.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this exercise I have learn how to use the 'class' option, how to center a component in the middle of a screen as well as responsible for any device

### Continued development

i would like to know more about stylizing, transition and responsive of a website

### Useful resources
